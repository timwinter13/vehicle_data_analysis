# Vehicle Data Analysis

This repository contains a small example of how I structure and analyze 
vehicle-related data using Python. The goal is to demonstrate my approach 
to tooling, data handling and clean code in a simple and transparent way.

## Contents
- `analyze_braking_data.py`: Example script for loading, filtering and visualizing data.
- `sample_braking_data.csv`: Dummy dataset with synthetic braking data.
- This README.

## Technologies
- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib

## Purpose
This repository is intended as a lightweight example to showcase my 
technical working style and interest in data-driven engineering topics.
